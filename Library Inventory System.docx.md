# **Library Inventory System Design and Implementation**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a Library Inventory System that manages the storage and checkout of items in a library. The system must adhere to the following specifications and constraints:

## **Storage System**

1\. Structure:  
\- The library storage is modeled using **shelves**, where:  
  \- Each shelf contains up to 15 **compartments**.  
  \- Each compartment can hold a single item.  
2\. Access:  
\- Implement the system so that it supports the **\[\]** **operator** for accessing items.  
\- For example, if the library storage is represented by a variable libraryInventory, you should be able to access the fifth compartment on the third shelf using: libraryInventory\[2\]\[4\].

## **Items in the Library**

1\. General Structure:  
\- All items should have the following properties:  
  \- **name**: Name of the item.  
  \- **description**: Description of the item.  
  \- **id**: Unique identifier for the item.

2\. Specific Item Types:  
\- Books:  
  \- **Additional properties:** title, author, and copyrightDate.  
\- Movies:  
  \- **Additional properties:** title, director, and a collection of mainActors.  
\- Magazines:  
  \- **Additional properties:** edition and the title of the main article.

3\. Operator Overloading:  
\- Overload the **\<\< operator** to display the details of each type of item.

## **System Operations**

1\. Add an Item:  
\- Add an item to the storage system at a specific shelf and compartment location.

2\. Checkout an Item:  
\- Allow a person to check out an item from a specific compartment.  
  \- When checked out:  
    \- Record the name of the person who checked out the item.  
    \- Record the due date for returning the item.

3\. Checkin an Item:  
\- Allow a person to return an item to its original compartment.

4\. Print Items in Storage:  
\- Print all items that are currently checked into storage, displaying their shelf and compartment locations.

5\. Print Checked-Out Items:  
\- Print all items that are currently checked out, along with:  
  \- The name of the person who checked them out.  
  \- Their due date.

6\. Swap Items:  
\- Swap the contents of two compartments in the library storage.  
\- Ensure there is an item in both compartments before performing the swap.

## **Requirements**

1\. Use classes to model the storage system, items, and operations. Organize your code in a clean and modular fashion.  
2\. Ensure proper handling of edge cases, such as:  
\- Attempting to access compartments or shelves that do not exist.  
\- Attempting to check out, check in, or swap items when a compartment is empty.  
3\. Demonstrate object-oriented programming principles, including:  
\- Encapsulation.  
\- Inheritance (for the item types).  
\- Polymorphism (where applicable).  
4\. Include appropriate input validation and error messages for invalid operations.

## **What You Must Submit**

1\. Class Definitions:  
\- Define all necessary classes (e.g., LibraryStorage, Item, Book, Movie, Magazine, etc.).

2\. Implementation:  
\- Implement the functionality described above, including operator overloads.

3\. Testing Code:  
\- Write a main function to test your library system:  
  \- Add items to storage.  
  \- Check out and check in items.  
  \- Print the current state of the storage and checked-out items.  
  \- Perform a swap operation and demonstrate error handling.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

\- Correctness:  
  \- Does the system correctly implement the described functionality?  
\- Code Quality:  
  \- Is the code well-organized, readable, and adherent to OOP principles?  
\- Testing:  
  \- Does the testing code cover all edge cases and demonstrate the functionality of the system?
